#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software systems.

*Reliability- it ensures software performs as expected without bias especially for critical applications like healthcare ,finance. 
*Efficiency - it helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
*Scalability and flexibility - it ensures that the system can handle an increased load without affecting performance.

2.Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
* planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
* design - building the framework. 
* coding - converting software design into tangible code.

3.Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* Software Developer - maintaining and updating software to keep it functional. 
* Quality Assurance - confirm that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
* Projcet Management - tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
  
4.Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
* An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software platform that facilitates the creation of other software applications by providing a space to write, compile, and debug code, sometimes with value-adding tools that reduce development efforts.
  - An IDE can format the written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors. These visual cues make the source code more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors.
* Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
 - Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
 - Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors

5.What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
* Time Constraints - Software engineering is a demanding and time-intensive field, often requiring engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines.
 Solution: adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints
* Changing Software Requirements - Software requirements are often dynamic and subject to frequent changes, making it challenging for engineers to design and develop solutions that meet users' needs while accounting for future updates and bug fixes. 
Solution: engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent components.

6.Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
* Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
* Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
* prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
  - Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language modelsâ€™ training data.
  - developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
* Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
 - Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
 - Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
